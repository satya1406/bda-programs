// Write a function to implement quicksort in scala using functional style programming.
// Use the filter operator with appropriate filters to find the elements less than the pivot
// and the elements more than the pivot.
// The sort should be recursive.

// The elements to be sorted can be provided as a list in the main function itself
// and the quicksort funtions should be called to sort the list elements.
// print both the original list and the sorted list onto the console.
