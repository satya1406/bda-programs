Use the same files used for IPLTopTeams application.

We want to find the percentage of game wins by teams which win the toss.
So lets say N games have been played.
Let us say there are M games where the team which has won the toss has
also won the game.
So we are looking for the percentage (M * 100 / N).
Perform the task using SQL code only.
