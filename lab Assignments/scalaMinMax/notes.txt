Take an input from the user via the console of the number of elements he/she will provide for which minimum and maximum value have to be found. Assume that all the elements are of type Int.

Let us say the user wants to provide 10 integers for which we have to find min and max.

Read in the 10 integers from the console.

Then print out the minimum and maximum.

Look at the code outline and notice the use of the StdIn and ArrayBuffer packages.
